# Basic-Shell-Scripting-Tutorial

## First Script
Since there are various kinds of shells in a Unix system, we usually define the type of shell we want to use in our shell script.
```
#!./bin/sh
```
Usually the shell is located in the `./bin` directory, the `!#` is followed by the path to the shell we wish to use. In this case, we are using the **Bourne Shell**. We can also use **bash** by typing
```
#!./bin/bash
```
